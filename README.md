# SALMON

SALMON (**S**ystems **A**nalysis and **L**earning for inferring **Mo**difiers of **N**etworks) is a network-based analysis tool for identifying molecular targets (proteins) of drugs from (time-series) gene expression data as well as prior information of protein-gene network. SALMON provides a perturbation score of each protein for a drug treatment sample of interest. The positive (negative) sign of score indicates enhancement (attenuation) of protein activity under a given drug treatment, and the greater magnitude of the score, the greater perturbation was caused by the drug action. Based on the magnitudes of scores, target proteins can be ranked.

Both MATLAB and R versions of SALMON package are available. Please refer to the SALMON manuscript for more detailed information about SALMON algorithm.
