# ProTINA

ProTINA (**Pro**tein **T**arget **I**nference by **N**etwork **A**nalysis) is a network-based analytical tool for identifying protein targets of compounds from gene transcriptional profiles. ProTINA scores proteins according to the enhancement or attenuation of the protein-gene regulatory interactions caused by a compound treatment. The magnitude of the scores indicates the degree of compound-induced alterations in the gene regulatory activity of a protein, while the sign of the scores indicates the direction of the alterations (positive: enhancement, negative: attenuation). In ProTINA, the protein targets of a compound are ranked according to the magnitudes of the protein scores. 

MATLAB and R versions of ProTINA are available. Please refer to ProTINA manuscript for more detailed information.
